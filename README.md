# VISSL Supervised ResNet-50 Training Tutorial

This tutorial provides a simple example of training a Supervised ResNet-50 model using VISSL (Vision Library) and understanding various parts of the model training configuration.

## Usage
1. Prepare Dataset : Prepare your dataset and dataloader according to PyTorch's standards. You can use standard datasets like ImageNet or your custom dataset. 
2. Create YAML Configuration : VISSL uses YAML files for configuring the training process. Here's a simple example of a YAML configuration for training a Supervised ResNet-50 model
3. Start Training : Once your dataset is prepared and YAML configuration is ready, you can start training your model using VISSL
4. Monitor Training : During training, VISSL will log various metrics like loss, accuracy, etc. You can visualize these metrics using TensorBoard or any other monitoring tool of your choice
5.Evaluate Model : Once training is complete, you can evaluate the trained model on your test dataset using VISSL's evaluation functionality.
