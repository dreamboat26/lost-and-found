# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This project implements Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using TensorFlow for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and inverse problems. PINNs combine the power of neural networks with the knowledge of physical laws to efficiently learn solutions to PDEs from data.

## Overview

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to solve complex physical problems with limited data. This repository provides an implementation of PINNs using TensorFlow, along with examples demonstrating their application in various domains.

## Features

- Implementation of PINNs for solving forward and inverse problems.
- Support for different types of PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations.
- Customizable neural network architectures for representing the solution.
- Data-driven discovery of physical parameters.
- Visualization tools for analyzing and interpreting results.
