# Finetuning Whisper Training

This project aims to finetune the Whisper-large-V2 model on Google Colab using PEFT-Lora and BNB INT8 training techniques. The goal is to improve the performance of the pre-trained Whisper model for specific tasks or domains.

## Overview

Whisper-large-V2 is a large-scale pre-trained language model designed for various natural language processing tasks. Finetuning involves training the model on a specific dataset or task to adapt it to new domains or improve its performance on particular tasks. PEFT-Lora (Parallel Efficient Fine-tuning) and BNB INT8 (Binarized Neural Network with Integer Quantization) are optimization techniques used to accelerate and compress the model during training.

## Features

- Finetuning the Whisper-large-V2 model for specific tasks or domains.
- Utilization of PEFT-Lora for parallel and efficient model training.
- Application of BNB INT8 training for model compression and quantization.
- Training on Google Colab for access to GPU resources and scalable computing power.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the finetuned model.

## Getting Started

To get started with finetuning Whisper-large-V2 on Google Colab using PEFT-Lora and BNB INT8 training, follow these steps:

1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook.
2. Upload the necessary dataset and files required for finetuning.
3. Execute the notebook cells to finetune the model using PEFT-Lora and BNB INT8 training techniques.
4. Monitor the training process and evaluate the performance of the finetuned model.

## Usage

### Uploading Dataset

Before starting the finetuning process, upload the dataset required for the specific task or domain you want to finetune the model on.

### Running the Notebook

Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform the finetuning process. Make sure to adjust hyperparameters and settings as needed for your specific use case.

### Evaluating the Finetuned Model

After finetuning, evaluate the performance of the finetuned model using appropriate evaluation metrics and test datasets.
