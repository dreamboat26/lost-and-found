# Streaming Generation from LLM using LangChain

This notebook demonstrates how to stream the generation output from your Large Language Models (LLMs) using LangChain, a framework for efficient and scalable language processing tasks.

## Overview

LangChain provides a convenient way to stream the output of LLMs, allowing for real-time generation of text without waiting for the entire output to be generated before displaying it. This can be useful for tasks such as conversational agents, text generation, and more.

## Usage

1. **Initialize the Model**: Load your LLM model using LangChain and specify the input prompt for generation.

2. **Stream Generation**: Use the `model.stream()` method to stream the generation output. Provide the input prompt as an argument to start generating text.

3. **Process the Output**: Iterate through the generated chunks of text and print or process them as needed.

## Dependencies
- LangChain
- Your LLM model implementation
Ensure that you have LangChain installed and your LLM model properly implemented before running the code.

## Notes
- Streaming generation allows for real-time processing of text output, which can be useful for interactive applications.
- Adjust the input prompt and other parameters as needed for your specific use case.

## Example

```python
# Initialize the LLM model with LangChain
from langchain.llms import YourLLMModel

model = YourLLMModel()

# Stream generation output
for chunk in model.stream("Write me a song about kubernetes"):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
