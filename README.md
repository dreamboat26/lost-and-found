# HealthCare ChatBot

## Introduction
Welcome to the HealthCare ChatBot! This project implements a chatbot that assists users in identifying potential health conditions based on symptoms. The chatbot utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and provide relevant medical information and precautions.

## Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up and run the chatbot:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary packages installed.
2. **Import Libraries**: Import the required libraries, including pandas, pyttsx3, and scikit-learn.
3. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load the training and testing data, preprocess it, and split it into features and labels.
4. **Train Machine Learning Models**: Train decision tree and SVM classifiers on the training data.
5. **Initialize ChatBot**: Set up functions to retrieve symptom severity, description, and precautions from CSV files.
6. **Run the ChatBot**: Start the chatbot, interact with users, and provide diagnosis and recommendations based on symptoms.

## Usage

You can run the provided code snippet to set up and use the HealthCare ChatBot. Make sure to have the necessary CSV files containing symptom severity, descriptions, and precautions.
