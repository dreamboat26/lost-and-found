# Zero-Shot Object Detection with YOLO-World

YOLO-World addresses a limitation of existing zero-shot object detection models by focusing on speed. Unlike other state-of-the-art models that rely on Transformers, which are powerful but typically slower architectures, YOLO-World leverages the faster CNN-based YOLO architecture.

According to the paper, YOLO-World achieves impressive performance metrics:
- The large version achieves 35.4 AP with 52.0 FPS.
- The small version achieves 26.2 AP with 74.1 FPS.

These metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of YOLO-World in balancing speed and accuracy. Achieving such high FPS rates, especially on devices with limited computational resources, underscores the practicality and efficiency of YOLO-World for zero-shot object detection tasks.
