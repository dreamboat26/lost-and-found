# Webcam Image and Video Processing with OpenCV in Google Colab

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to access and process images and video captured from your webcam using OpenCV in Google Colab. We'll utilize OpenCV's Haar Cascade for face detection on both images and live video streams.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `numpy`: Library for numerical operations.
- `PIL`: Python Imaging Library for image processing.
- `opencv-python`: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
- `google.colab`: Google Colab library for interactive notebooks.

You can install the dependencies using pip:

## Webcam Image Processing

To capture images from your webcam and perform image processing tasks like face detection, follow these steps:
- Capture Image: Use the take_photo function to capture an image from your webcam.
- Face Detection: Utilize the Haar Cascade face detection model to detect faces in the captured image.
- Display Image: Display the processed image with bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Webcam Video Processing

To process live video streams from your webcam and perform tasks like real-time face detection, follow these steps:
- Start Video Stream: Execute the video_stream function to start streaming video from your webcam.
- Face Detection: Apply the Haar Cascade face detection model to each frame of the video stream.
- Overlay Bounding Box: Create transparent overlays with bounding boxes around detected faces and overlay them onto the video stream.
- Display Video Stream: Display the processed video stream with real-time face detection.
