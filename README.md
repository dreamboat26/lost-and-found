# Contrastive Classification with Keras

This project demonstrates the implementation of contrastive classification using Keras, a high-level neural networks API. Contrastive classification is a technique that combines contrastive learning with traditional classification to improve model performance, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data.

## Introduction

Contrastive classification aims to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data by learning representations that maximize the similarity between samples of the same class while minimizing the similarity between samples of different classes. This approach helps the model generalize better to unseen data and improves classification accuracy.

## Implementation

The implementation includes the following components:

- **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset, including labeled and unlabeled samples. Ensure that the data is preprocessed and split into appropriate training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Architecture**: Define the neural network architecture for contrastive classification using Keras. This typically involves a shared encoder network followed by classification layers.
- **Loss Function**: Implement a contrastive loss function that encourages similar samples to have similar embeddings and dissimilar samples to have dissimilar embeddings.
- **Training**: Train the model using labeled and unlabeled data. Utilize techniques like data augmentation, semi-supervised learning, and regularization to improve model generalization.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the test set and analyze its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the learned embeddings using techniques like t-SNE or PCA to understand how the model clusters different classes in the feature space.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow or other compatible backend
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and organize it into appropriate directories.
2. Define the model architecture and loss function in Keras.
3. Train the model using the labeled and unlabeled data.
4. Evaluate the trained model on the test set and analyze its performance.
5. Visualize the learned embeddings to gain insights into the model's behavior.
