# ðŸ‘• Assigning Football Players to Teams by Uniform Color with GPT-4V

This project explores the use of [GPT-4V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card) in sports analytics, specifically in the context of football. Its primary aim was to evaluate whether GPT-4V could effectively distinguish and assign players to teams based on the color of their uniforms. This was achieved through the implementation of several advanced vision prompting techniques.
