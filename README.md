# Image Generation with Stable Diffusion XL using ðŸ¤— Diffusers

This notebook demonstrates text-conditional image generation with the Stable Diffusion XL model using ðŸ¤— Diffusers. It includes managing image generation experiments using Weights & Biases and logging prompts, generated images, and experiment configurations to Weights & Biases for visualization.

## Overview

The Stable Diffusion XL model, combined with ðŸ¤— Diffusers, allows for high-quality text-conditional image generation. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform such image generation experiments and visualize the results using Weights & Biases.

## Contents

1. Setup and Installation: Install dependencies and set up the environment.
2. Loading the Model: Load the Stable Diffusion XL model with ðŸ¤— Diffusers for image generation.
3. Managing Experiments: Set up Weights & Biases for managing image generation experiments.
4. Text-Conditional Image Generation: Generate images based on text prompts using the loaded model.
5. Logging to Weights & Biases: Log the prompts, generated images, and experiment configurations to Weights & Biases for visualization.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

- ðŸ¤— Diffusers: Provides access to the Stable Diffusion XL model for image generation.
- Weights & Biases: Library for experiment tracking and visualization.
- Other necessary libraries for text processing and image handling.
