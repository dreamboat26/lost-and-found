# âš½  Football Players Tracking with YOLOv5 + ByteTrack

I have long been fascinated by the use of Computer Vision in sports. After all, it is a combination of two things I love. Almost three years ago, I wrote a post on my personal blog in which I triedâ€Šâ€”â€Šat that time, still using YOLOv3â€Šâ€”â€Što [detect and classify basketball players on the court](https://towardsdatascience.com/chess-rolls-or-basketball-lets-create-a-custom-object-detection-model-ef53028eac7d).

# ðŸ¤¸  3D Football Players Pose Estimation with YOLOv7

I was watching a FIFA 2022 World Cup match the other day, and one of the things that caught my eye was VAR - Video Assistant Referee, or to be more precise, the part of it responsible for analyzing whether a player was on the offside.

# ðŸ‘• Assigning Football Players to Teams by Uniform Color with GPT-4V

This project explores the use of [GPT-4V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card) in sports analytics, specifically in the context of football. Its primary aim was to evaluate whether GPT-4V could effectively distinguish and assign players to teams based on the color of their uniforms. This was achieved through the implementation of several advanced vision prompting techniques.
