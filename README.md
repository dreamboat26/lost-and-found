# Running DeepSort Object Tracking with YOLO Object Detections in Google Colab!

This tutorial will guide you through the process of running DeepSort Object Tracking on Google Colab GPU using YOLOv4 Object Detections.

Object tracking is implemented with YOLOv4, DeepSort, and TensorFlow. YOLOv4 is a state-of-the-art algorithm that utilizes deep convolutional neural networks for object detections. We can take the output of YOLOv4 and feed these object detections into Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) to create a highly accurate object tracker.

## Steps:

1. **Setup Environment**: Set up the Google Colab environment and import necessary libraries.

2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository containing the code for DeepSort object tracking with YOLOv4.

3. **Download YOLOv4 Weights**: Download the pre-trained YOLOv4 weights.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install required dependencies for YOLOv4 and DeepSort.

5. **Perform Object Detection**: Use YOLOv4 to perform object detection on a sample video or image.

6. **Run DeepSort Object Tracking**: Apply DeepSort object tracking on the detected objects.

7. **Visualize Results**: Visualize the tracked objects in the video or image.

Follow along with the code cells provided in the notebook to execute each step and achieve object tracking with DeepSort and YOLOv4 on Google Colab GPU.
