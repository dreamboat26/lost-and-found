# Semantic Segmentation with DPT (Data-efficient image Transformer)

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for performing semantic segmentation on images using the DPT (Data-efficient image Transformer) model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class label, such as person, car, or building.
