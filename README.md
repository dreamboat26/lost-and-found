**DEâ«¶TR**: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers
========

PyTorch training code and pretrained models for **DETR** (**DE**tection **TR**ansformer).
We replace the full complex hand-crafted object detection pipeline with a Transformer, and match Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50, obtaining **42 AP** on COCO using half the computation power (FLOPs) and the same number of parameters. Inference in 50 lines of PyTorch.
