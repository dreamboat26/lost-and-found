## Introduction

Transformers are a type of model introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017). They are widely used in various applications, including machine translation, text summarization, and more. This repository provides a step-by-step guide to building a transformer model from the ground up.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformers-from-scratch.git
cd transformers-from-scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the Jupyter notebook to explore the implementation.

## Architecture

The transformer architecture consists of:

1. Encoder: Processes the input data.
2. Decoder: Generates the output data.
3. Multi-head Self-attention: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
4. Positional Encoding: Adds information about the position of tokens in the sequence.

## Training

To train the transformer model, you can modify the parameters in the notebook. The training process involves:

1. Defining the loss function.
2. Choosing an optimizer.
3. Running the training loop on a dataset.

## Results

You can evaluate the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, BLEU score, etc. Results will be displayed in the Jupyter notebook after training.
